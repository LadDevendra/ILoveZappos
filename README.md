# ILoveZappos
Android Application Challenge

This challenge servers as a submission to the Zappos Family completing their Android Developer Internship Role.

This is completely my design from scratch. This App takes input from the user as a search query and returns the first item
(there could be more than one) and display it as a product page. 
The app contains floating action button on the screen that does some sort of animation to indicate that something has been
added to a cart.

Tasks Done:<br/>
1) <a href="www.google.com">Android DataBinding</a> for Product page.<br/>
2) <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/animation/index.html">Animation</a> for product Add or Remove from cart.<br/>
3) <a href="https://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a> for REST requests.<br/>
4) <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/">Material Design Guidlines</a> for floating button and other UI components.<br/>
5) Facade Design pattern used for Implementing services provided by zappos. More services can be added in future.<br/>
